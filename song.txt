She was a princess, she could've been a queen,
She had the angels beneath her broken wings,
She had the vision, she had the sight,
She wants perfection, she wants it right.
Who cares anymore, what's right anymore?

He lives in darkness, there is no progress,
He knows the demons, the lie within him,
He has no vision, he has no sight,
He hates perfection, it wasn't right!

I won't lie, I've never been ashamed
I don't mind, admitting I'm to blame
I care no more, I can't bare no more
I'll say no more, I can't give you anymore
(I question everything!)

Who cares anymore, who's there anymore?
